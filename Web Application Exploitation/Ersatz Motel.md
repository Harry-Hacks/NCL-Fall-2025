# Ersatz Motel (Medium, 100 points)

One of our field agents stationed at the Ersatz Motel needs access to the admin panel to extract the RFID code from the room tied to Liber8tion activity, but they are unable to access it directly due to security restrictions.

To get the RFID code for the room to use with an RFID spoofer, they need to extract the admin password.

Luckily, motel security is weak enough to exploit via SQL injection attack. However, the only accessible page is the room reservation system.

Note: Your scope is limited to HTTPS. You may use automated tools that make educated guesses for this challenge, but blind automated brute force is not permitted.

Warning: Some tools seem to be using an outdated certificate authority or not using the built in system certificates causing them to have SSL errors when connecting to this website. Be sure that your system and browser are both up to date.
